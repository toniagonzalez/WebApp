# WebApp
This ASP.NET MVC Web Application includes an employee directory and a dashboard. 

- The directory is built using a JSON object requested from the Random User Generator API using fetch. I parsed the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.

- The dashboard allows user to see new members, recent Activity, and view charts  Chart.js.
